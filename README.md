# RailsConf 2019 Stimulus and Webpacker Workshop

This code base is for use during the [2019 RailsConf Stimulus workshop](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-781)

In order to run this application, you need SQLlite on your
machine.

This application was developed with Ruby 2.6.2, but should run with any
version of Ruby 2.5 and up (which is the prerequisite for Rails 6.0)

In order to get set up, you should do the following

1. Clone and download this repository
2. In the directory for this repo, make sure you are running Rails 2.5 or up
3. run `bundle install`
4. run `yarn`
5. go to http://localhost:3000
6. You should see a webpage that looks like a schedule


If you wish to use Docker, you can run
1. `docker-compose up`
1. Wait....it will take a while before the app is running.
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
